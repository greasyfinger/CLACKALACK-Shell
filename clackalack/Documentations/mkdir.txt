mkdir [-options] [directories]
The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified in the command line.

options
     -p             Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is not specified, the full path prefix of each operand must already exist.  On the
                    other hand, with this option specified, no error will be reported if a directory given as an operand already exists.

     -v             Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they are created.

Errors
      1.     prompt thrown if directory already exists
      2.     prompt thrown if invalid options are used
      3.     prompt thrown creation of direcotry is unsuccessful
      4.     prompt throw if path doesn't already exist and p flag not used
